# Switcher
A simple Velocity plugin that allows players to join from multiple game profiles using a domain
# How it works?
Before joining the server, add the prefix `switch-<username>` to your server address. This will allow you to play the player with the given username. For example, the entire address should look like this: `switch-Herobrine.example.com`
## Important!
Your original account must have `switcher.domain` permission to disguise as another player
# Dependencies
This plugin currently works only with [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/)!
